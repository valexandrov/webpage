I joined this research group in 2018, after completing my M.S. (with distinction) at the Department of Theoretical Physics and Quantum Technologies at NUST MISiS, Russia. I received my PhD at the Department of Materials Engineering, UNL, in 2022. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
