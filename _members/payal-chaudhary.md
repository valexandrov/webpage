I joined this research group as a graduate student in 2021, after completing my Integrated Dual Degree (IDD) in Materials Science and Technology at Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India. My research at UNL is focused on understanding the origin of super-Nernstian pH-potential shifts in water-splitting electrocatalysts.
