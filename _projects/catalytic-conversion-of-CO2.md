The problem of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions has been recently attracting a lot of attention due to a dramatic rise of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere in the last few decades. The design of new catalysts with improved efficiency and selectivity that would enable low-cost CO<sub>2</sub> conversion to valuable chemicals is necessary for sustainable carbon-free economics. We aim to contribute to the development of a comprehensive atomistic understanding of CO<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanisms over non-metal and metal-oxide based catalysts under realistic reaction conditions.
