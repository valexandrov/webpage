Our research in computational electrocatalysis focuses on developing fundamental understanding of atomistic mechanisms underlying activity, stability, and selectivity of water-splitting electrocatalysts. We are particularly interested in how structure, composition and dynamics of the electrode and electrical double layer affect catalytic properties. To this end, we are employing a variety of computational tools such as density-functional-theory based thermodynamics and molecular dynamics, electronic-structure and quantum-transport calculations. We are also utilizing the methods of machine learning to assist computational screening to identify promising catalytic materials.
